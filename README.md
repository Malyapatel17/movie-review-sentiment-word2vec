# üé¨ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Word2Vec (Built from Scratch)

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that performs **sentiment analysis on movie reviews** using a **Word2Vec model built from scratch** (no pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or Google News).

> üöß Note: Since Word2Vec is implemented manually, the accuracy may be lower than state-of-the-art models. This project is a learning exercise to deepen understanding of core NLP techniques and word embeddings.

## üîç Project Objective

- Build a **custom Word2Vec model** using Skip-gram approach.
- Train it on a small corpus of labeled movie reviews.
- Analyze word vectors and perform **sentiment classification**.

---

## üß† What You'll Learn

- Basics of word embedding (Word2Vec)
- How skip-gram works
- Vector similarity concepts
- Building a neural net with NumPy
- Preprocessing for NLP: tokenization, cleaning, etc.
- Understanding how embedding vectors influence model accuracy
